 * Qt::WA_UnderMouse was not correctly updated by Qt. QTBUG-27478 reports
 * that problem (solved in Qt5 but not backported to Qt4). Patching Qt does
 * not seem to solve entirely our problem (we maybe expect a behaviour that
 * is not standard). So that overriding {enter,leave}Event to force the
 * parent widget's Qt::WA_UnderMouse attribute to a correct value that do
 * what we want.
 *
 * @note RH: when the popup is visible, a wheel event outside the popup
 * do a weird zoom. It can be solved by forwarding mouse move events from
 * the popup widget to its parent.
