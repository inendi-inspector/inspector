/*! \mainpage PVKernel library
 *
 * The PVKernel library handles all the transformation of data (binary, text, etc.) into a normalized table (called nraw). 
 * It is based in three modules.

 * \section rushlib PVRush library
 * \subsection rushintro Introduction
 *
 * PVRush has the single task to take any type of file (that is stored in a given place)
 * and create a CSV-like version of it that is stored in memory. It also manages the
 * extraction of these data.
 * 
 * This memory CSV-like is called a \b NRAW (for Normalized Raw). 
 *
 * \subsection rushhowto How it works
 *
 * TODO: write this section :)
 *
 * 
 * \subsection rushsources Sources in PVRush
 *
 * The interface of a source is defined by \ref PVRawSource. The responsability of a source
 * is to create chunks that are then processed by a TBB pipeline.
 * involved in the creation of a source.
 *
 * \subsection rushinput Input connectors
 *
 * The input are segmented with two main properties :
 * <ul>
 * <li>where it comes from (a local file, a database). Handled by the "input type" plugins</li>
 * <li>the contained data (PCAP packets, text data, SQL result, etc...). It is handled by the" 
 * </ul>
