-----------------

This minor releases add the following features:

3.0.4
-----

(internal release)

3.0.3
-----

This minor release add the following features:

 * add a "duplicate" splitter into the format builder, so that a field can be
   duplicate, so that different processing can be applied

This minor release fixes:

 * invalid values for the frequency gradient in some rare cases some arguments
 * weren't updated when using a filter selection ivnertion works after a filter
 * has been applied invalid lines were displayed in some rare cases in the

 * plotting mode "logarithmic min/max" was in some cases not distributed.
Moreover, expanding a selection on a axis using the logarithmic mode gave
wrong results.

 * race condition that involved a random crash when loading one or more files
 * closing Picviz Inspector when some views are opened do not longer cause the

 * ability to directly modify, in the mapping/plotting edit dialog, the parameters of a type (like the time format)

New filters:
 * multiple and selection-based search
 * create layers based on regular expressions

Improvements:
 * improve interface design
 * really reduce the overall amount of RAM usage
 * set the number of maximum lines to 15 millions
 * improve listing sorting and displaying performances

Bug fixes :

 * fix bug in the URL splitter that could cause a crash with some inputs

Known issues :
 * if you have this error message when starting the application:

  Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
  Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
  Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
  Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

 it means that the incorporated python interpreter couldn't find a python installation.
 This is currently used by the "Snort for logs" plugin.
 A solution is to install the "python3.2" debian package. A workaround is to remove
 the file layer-filters/liblayer_snort_for_logs.so .
