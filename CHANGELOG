Known issues :
 * if you have this error message when starting the application:

  Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
  Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
  Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
  Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

 it means that the incorporated python interpreter couldn't find a python installation.
 This is currently used by the "Snort for logs" plugin.
 A solution is to install the "python3.2" debian package. A workaround is to remove
 the file layer-filters/liblayer_snort_for_logs.so .
