2.4.0 (23/01/2012)
------------------

New features:
 * sorting plugins allow columns to be sorted according to their types
 * list unique values of a column (for a given selection)
 * ability to set the current selection as the selection of a given layer
 * ability to directly modify, in the mapping/plotting edit dialog, the parameters of a type (like the time format)

New filters:
 * multiple and selection-based search
 * create layers based on regular expressions

Improvements:
 * improve interface design
 * really reduce the overall amount of RAM usage
 * set the number of maximum lines to 15 millions
 * improve listing sorting and displaying performances
 * improve visualisation performance by caching some intensive computations
 * improve lines drawing performances
 * performance improvements of the search filters
 * performance improvements of some core algorithms

Bug fixes :
 * fix crashes due to bad listing synchronisation with the OpenGL views
 * do not crash when an invalid mapping and/or plotting is used in a format
 * fix bug in the URL splitter that could cause a crash with some inputs

Known issues :
 * if you have this error message when starting the application:

  Could not find platform independent libraries <prefix>
  Could not find platform dependent libraries <exec_prefix>
  Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to <prefix>[:<exec_prefix>]
  Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
  LookupError: no codec search functions registered: can't find encoding

 it means that the incorporated python interpreter couldn't find a python installation.
 This is currently used by the "Snort for logs" plugin.
 A solution is to install the "python3.2" debian package. A workaround is to remove
 the file layer-filters/liblayer_snort_for_logs.so .
