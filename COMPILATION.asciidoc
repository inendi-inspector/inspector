What you should know or thing to when your compilation fails
============================================================

GCC Changes
-----------

New architecture names have been added in GCC 4.9; they superseed older values
(like _sandybridge_ which replaces _corei7-avx_). Building in developer mode does
not cause any problem but in customer mode, it can lead to an unoptimized
program (or a compilation failure).

[NOTE]

====
_corei7-avx_ is still supported by GCC 4.9.0, an unsupported value
should produce the following error message:

----
file.c:1:0: error: bad value (corei7-avx) for -march= switch

FAQ
---

Q: My compilation is crappy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is often due to a wrong CMake invocation (which can be automatically runned
after a _CMakeLists.txt_ file update). Remove the _CMakeCache.txt_ in your build
root directory and rerun CMake as it was the first time.

Q: All intrinsics macros are not defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run _make VERBOSE=1_ to see if _-march_ is present. If not, consider your
compilation is crappy.
